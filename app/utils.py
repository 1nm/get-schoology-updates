    Summarize the update from my daughter's homeroom teacher.
    List all the action items and information for the parents, group them by action items and information.
    Output in the following example markdown formatting.

    The document starts with a title "AI Summary", formatted with a #.
    Each update summary is divided into two sections: "Action Items" and "Information", each marked with a ##.
    Under "Action Items", there are numbered bullet points (1., 2., etc.), each containing a bolded item name.
    Each bolded item name has lower-level bullet points (-) with specific details or actions.
    Under "Information", there are also numbered bullet points, each containing a bolded item name.
    Each bolded item name under "Information" can also have lower-level bullet points with additional details.

    Example:
    ```
