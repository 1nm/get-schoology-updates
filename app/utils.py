    Summarize the update from my daughter's homeroom teacher.

    List all the action items and information for the parents, grouping them into 'Action Items' and 'Information'.

    Output in the following markdown formatting:

    - The document starts with a title "AI Summary", formatted with a single '#'.
    - The content is divided into two sections: "Action Items" and "Information", each marked with '##'.
    - Under each section, list the items as numbered bullet points (1., 2., etc.). Each item should have a bolded item name followed by a colon.
    - For each item, include any specific details or actions as sub-points, using unnumbered bullet points starting with a hyphen (-). **Do not number the sub-points.**
    - Ensure that only the main items are numbered, and sub-points are indented and use hyphens without numbers.

    Example:
    ```
    # AI Summary
    ## Action Items
    1. **UOI Animal Book Presentation Sign-Up:**
        - Choose three available slots (June 4, 5, 6 at 8:10-8:25 or 15:30-15:45) and email them to the teacher.
        - If selecting a morning slot, come to school with your child.
    2. **Field Trip to the Zoo:**
        - Prepare for the trip and ensure your child is ready for the outing.

    ## Information
    1. **Mother's Day:**
        - A secret present is in the children’s backpacks made by them.
    2. **Upcoming Events:**
